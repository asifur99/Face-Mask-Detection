# Face-Mask-Detection

Project for COMP 4102 course

# Abstract

I have implemented a system where it will detect a user in real time and determine if they are wearing a mask or not. I have utilized the CNN architecture for image recognition, object detection and segmentation but I have tweaked it a little bit to be more accurate than the traditional CNN architecture with the help of MobileNetV2.
